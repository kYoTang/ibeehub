== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Toujours includes support for a few Jetpack features, including Infinite Scroll, Site Logo, and Featured Content (the posts are displayed in the slideshow in the blog page).

= How do I use the Guestbook Template? =

You can use the Guestbook Template by following these steps:

1. Create a new page, or edit an existing page.
2. Under Page Attributes, change the Template to Guestbook.
3. Under Discussion, make sure that 'Allow comments.' is checked.

= How do I add the Featured Content slideshow =

The Featured Content slideshow requires the Jetpack plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/). Once installed, it can be set up following these steps:

1. In the Customizer > Featured Content, enter a post tag to use to mark Featured Content. Click Save & Publish.
2. Add that tag to posts you would like to show in the Featured Content slideshow.
3. The posts will automatically appear in the slideshow, at the top of the blog page. They will use the Featured Image from each post, and display the title and published date overtop.

= How do I add the three most recent posts above the rest on the blog page? =

Toujours allows you to display the three most recent posts in a special area above the other posts on the blog page. To do this:

1. Navigate to the Customizer > Theme Options.
2. Check the checkbox labelled "Display the three most recent posts in a special area above your other posts". Click Save & Publish.
3. Your three most recent posts will automatically appear above the rest of the posts on the blog page. They will each display a Featured Image, and an excerpt from the post.
